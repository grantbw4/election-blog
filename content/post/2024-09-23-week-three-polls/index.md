# Introduction

In this second blog post, I want to explore

## 2) and, if so, how well

The code used to produce these visualizations is publicly available in my [github repository](https://github.com/grantbw4/election-blog) and draws heavily from the section notes and sample code provided by the Gov 1347 Head Teaching Fellow, [Matthew Dardet](https://www.matthewdardet.com/harvard-election-analytics-2024/).
